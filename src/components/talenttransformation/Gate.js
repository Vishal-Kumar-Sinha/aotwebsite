            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In the present era, a valid GATE score is
            undeniably a very important aspect in engineering education. The
            rapidly escalating number of students applying for GATE every year
            attests to this. From 7,77,134 applicants in 2012 to 9,22,167 in
            2017, this number has increased by 18.66% in merely 5 years.

                  Every year almost all the top Indian PSUs (ONGC, BHEL, NTPC,
                  BPCL, CEL, Indian Oil, Power Grid, etc.) recruit engineering
                  students for thousands of vacancies and for these a valid GATE
                  score is mandatory. Nowadays, high salary and service security
                  make PSU jobs more lucrative than private sector jobs.
                  Moreover, jobs in the private sector, including IT sector, are
                  decreasing day by day due to recession, automation, global
                  foreign policy, etc.
