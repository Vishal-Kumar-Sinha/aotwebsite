              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In the present era, a valid GATE score is
              undeniably a very important aspect in engineering education. The
              rapidly escalating number of students applying for GATE every year
              attests to this. From 7,77,134 applicants in 2012 to 9,22,167 in
              2017, this number has increased by 18.66% in merely 5 years.

                    Every year almost all the top Indian PSUs (ONGC, BHEL, NTPC,
                    BPCL, CEL, Indian Oil, Power Grid, etc.) recruit engineering
                    students for thousands of vacancies and for these a valid
                    GATE score is mandatory. Nowadays, high salary and service
                    security make PSU jobs more lucrative than private sector
                    jobs. Moreover, jobs in the private sector, including IT
                    sector, are decreasing day by day due to recession,
                    automation, global foreign policy, etc.
